                <![CDATA[
					Bowen's Camp is likely to have been constructed and occupied in the late 1920s and early 1930s as shelter during the 'Great Depression'. Some structures may have been occupied into the 1940s. The complex is similar to temporary housing constructed unofficially during this period in locations that were on the margins of Sydney.

            <description>
                <![CDATA[
					The King Family's Farm was in operation prior to World War I and had ceased to exist by the 1950s. Poultry-raising, pig-raising and a boiling down works are likely to have been the principal occupations carried out at the farm. The property was also used for vegetable growing. The main residence was located adjacent to Wolli Avenue and a range of outbuildings extended down the slope towards the Creek. Much of the site identified in 1992 is now occupied by housing in part and by S. J. Harrison Reserve.

                <![CDATA[
					Burrell's Farm is described as the Bray Avenue complex and contains three major elements that are not necessarily related in terms of function or age. The first may be the remains of a small cottage, the second that of a tennis court and the third that of a dam. The complex appears to have developed after 1900. Between 1930 and 1943 additional buildings were constructed on the site.

					Market Gardens and Dipping Well is a collection of features in Turrella Reserve. In 1992 these consisted of a well, Coral Tree planting and relict field divisions. They occupied the southern portion of the reserve adjacent to the path and footbridge leading to Turrella Railway Station. There are no structural remains visible on the surface although sub-surface evidence may exist in the area.

					This is a weir over Wolli Creek located at the end of Henderson Street. The weir has been substantially modified and it is difficult to separate early in situ fabric from re-used material. It is likely that this location was the site of a ford across Wolli Creek that was reformed at a later date as a weir.

					Jackson's Quarry was operated by William Jackson. Historian, George Morgan, in his research for The Story of Stone in the Wolli Creek Valley, states that, '...the name William Jackson, Unwin's Bridge Road, occupation, quarryman, first appears on the electoral roll of 1894...the Sands Directory lists the Jackson quarry, in Unwin's Bridge Road (now Bayview Avenue), as operating from 1905-1908, although the actual operational period probably extended beyond this date...'.

					Drystone Wall is a wall running north-south from the eastern limit of Highcliffe Road towards the creek. The date of construction is unknown. Clearance of part of the site since 1992 has revealed rock cut steps and an emu carved into rock. This may have been part of a larger complex. A second dry stone wall located in thick scrub to the east was observed during the survey of 2015.

					This feature consists of an earthen mound with a sandstone rubble core extending into the intertidal zone of the creek for a distance of approximately 40m with a return to the west along the face of the creek. In 1992 this was identified as a jetty. But an examination of aerial photographs from the 1930s to the 1950s indicates that this was the eastern and southern bund of a market garden complex.

					This site is of a small overhang in the sandstone ledges bordering the northern bank of the creek at the eastern limit of the mangroves. A small retaining wall was added to the western side to form a shelter. A line of stones along the southern margin may indicate that the southern side of the overhang was also enclosed. It was considered that the structure may have been used as a shelter during the 1930s Depression.

					This site is the Wolli Creek Sewage Aqueduct completed in 1895. This formed part of an integrated system of sewer lines that served Sydney and suburbs. It was part of the original Western Main Carrier and now forms part of the Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer System. This item was one of the Water Board's major construction programs and forms a significant element in the landscape. The structure is well-maintained.

            <description>
                <![CDATA[
					Weir Associated with Flood Mitigation Works was originally identified as a weir constructed as part of flood mitigation works of the 1920s. The evidence consisted of timbers set in the mangrove margin on the southern side of the Creek. No traces were observed on the northern shore. It was generally believed that this structure was a weir and crossing point. Further research has indicated that this was a temporary crossing and lock on Wolli Creek.
